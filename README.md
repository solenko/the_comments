## Installation

This gem has many steps to install. Be careful when installing and keep calm.

Just follow an installation instruction step by step and everything will be fine!

**Installation process consist of 4 main steps:**

* [Gem Installation](#gem-installation)
* [Code Installation](#code-installation)
* [Tuning](#tuning)
* [Using](#using)

## Gem Installation

**1)** change your Gemfile

```ruby
# I use *awesome_nested_set* gem to provide threading for comments
# But you can use other nested set gem, for example:
# gem 'nested_set' (github.com/skyeagle/nested_set)
gem 'awesome_nested_set'

# I use haml for default views
# You can remove this dependancy,
# but you will should rewrite default views with your template engine
gem 'haml'

# finally, this gem
gem 'the_comments'
```

**2)** bundle

**3)** Copy migration file into application, <b>OPEN FILE AND FOLLOW AN INSTRUCTION</b>.

```ruby
bundle exec rake the_comments_engine:install:migrations
```

**4)** run migration

```ruby
bundle exec rake db:migrate
```

## Code Installation

**1)** Assets

*app/assets/javascripts/application.js*

```js
//= require the_comments
//= require the_comments_manage
```

*app/assets/stylesheets/application.css*

```css
*= require the_comments
```

**2)** Change your ApplicationController

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include TheCommentsController::ViewToken
end
```

**3)** Run generator, <b>OPEN EACH OF CREATED FILES AND FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS</b>.

```ruby
bundle exec rails g the_comments install
```

*List of created files:*

```ruby
config/initializers/the_comments.rb

app/models/ip_black_list.rb
app/models/user_agent_black_list.rb

app/controllers/comments_controller.rb
app/controllers/ip_black_lists_controller.rb
app/controllers/user_agent_black_lists_controller.rb
```

**4)** Copy view files into your application

```ruby
bundle exec rails g the_comments:views views
```

*List of created directories with view files:*

```ruby
app/views/the_comments/*.haml
app/views/ip_black_lists/*.haml
app/views/user_agent_black_lists/*.haml
```

**4)** Mount engine routes
```
config/routes.rb
<YourApp>::Application.routes.draw do

  mount TheComments::Engine => '/'
end
 ```


## Tuning

### User Model

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  include TheCommentsUser

  # Your implementation of role policy
  def admin?
    self == User.first
  end

  # Comments moderator checking (simple example)
  # Usually comment's holder should be moderator
  def comment_moderator? comment
    admin? || id == comment.holder_id
  end
end
```

### Any Commentable Model (Page, Blog, Article, User(!) ...)

Read more about **commentable_title**, **commentable_url** and **commentable_state** methods here: [Denormalization and Recent comments](#denormalization)

```ruby
class Blog < ActiveRecord::Base
  include TheCommentsCommentable

  def commentable_title
    # by default: try(:title) || TheComments.config.default_title
    # for example: "My first blog post"
    blog_post_name
  end

  def commentable_url
    # by default:  ['', self.class.to_s.tableize, self.to_param].join('/')
    # for example: "/blogs/1-my-first-blog-post"
    ['', self.class.to_s.tableize, slug_id].join('/')
  end

  def commentable_state
    # by default:  try(:state)
    # for example: "draft"
    self.ban_flag == true ? :banned : :published
  end
end
```

### Comment Model


```ruby
class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
  include TheCommentsBase

  # Define comment's avatar url
  # Usually we use Comment#user (owner of comment) to define avatar
  # @blog.comments.includes(:user) <= use includes(:user) to decrease queries count
  # comment#user.avatar_url

  # Simple way to define avatar url
  def avatar_url
    hash = Digest::MD5.hexdigest self.id.to_s
    "http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/#{hash}?s=30&d=identicon"
  end

  # Define your filters for content
  # Expample for: gem 'RedCloth', gem 'sanitize'
  # your personal SmilesProcessor
  def prepare_content
    text = self.raw_content
    text = RedCloth.new(text).to_html
    text = SmilesProcessor.new(text)
    text = Sanitize.clean(text, Sanitize::Config::RELAXED)
    self.content = text
  end
end
```

## Using

### Commentable controller

```ruby
class BlogsController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @blog     = Blog.where(id: params[:id]).with_states(:published).first
    @comments = @blog.comments.with_state([:draft, :published]).nested_set
  end
end
```

### View

```ruby
%h1= @blog.title
%p=  @blog.content

= render partial: 'the_comments/tree', locals: { commentable: @blog, comments_tree: @comments }
```

## Understanding

### My hopes about comments system

* Open comments for everybody (by default). *I hate user registration*
* Polymorphic comments for any AR Model
* Threading for comments (can be plain comments list)
* Cache counters for commentable objects and User
* Moderation for comments and simple Admin UI
* Spam traps instead Captcha. *I hate Captcha*
* Blacklists for IP and UserAgent
* Denormalization for fast and Request-free Recent comments building
* Ready for external content filters (<b>sanitize</b>, <b>RedCloth</b>, <b>Markdown</b>, etc)
* Highlighting and Jumping to comment via anchor
* Ready for Rails4 (and Rails::Engine)
* Ready for JQuery 1.9+
* Delete without destroy

### What's wrong with other gems?

Just look at [Ruby-Toolbox](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/categories/rails_comments). What we can see?

* [Acts as commentable with threading](https://github.com/elight/acts_as_commentable_with_threading) - so, guys, where is the render helper for the tree? There is no helper! Should  I make render helper for tree by myself? Nooooo!!! I'm so sorry, but I can't use this gem. 
* [acts_as_commentable](https://github.com/jackdempsey/acts_as_commentable) - so, I can see code for models. But I can't see code for controllers and views. Unfortunately, there is no threading. It's not enough for me.
* [opinio](https://github.com/Draiken/opinio) - looks better, but there is no threading. I want to have more!
* [has_threaded_comments](https://github.com/aarongough/has_threaded_comments) - Nice work! Nice gem! Models, controllers, views, view helper for tree rendering! **But**, last activity 2 years ago, I need few features, I think - I can make it better.

## Comments, Posted comments, ComComs

### Posted comments

**@user.posted_comments** (has_many)

Set of comments, where current user is owner (creator).

```ruby
@my_comments = @user.posted_comments # => [comment, comment, ...]

@comment =  @my_comments.first
@user.id == @comment.user_id # => true
```

### Comments

**@commentable.comments** (has_many)

Set of comments for this commentable object

```ruby
@comments = @blog.comments # => [comment, comment, ...]

@comment = @comments.first
@comment.commentable_id   == @blog.id # => true
@comment.commentable_type == 'Blog'   # => true
```

<b>(!) Attention:</b>  User Model can be commentable object too!

```ruby
@comments = @user.comments # => [comment, comment, ...]

@comment = @comments.first
@comment.commentable_id   == @user.id  # => true
@comment.commentable_type == 'User'    # => true
```

### ComComs (COMments of COMmentable objects)

**@user.comcoms**  (has_many)

Set of All <b>COM</b>ments of All <b>COM</b>mentable objects of this User

```ruby
@comcoms = @user.comcoms # => [comment, comment, ...]

@comcom  =  @comcoms.first
@user.id == @comcom.holder_id  # => true
```

**Comment#holder_id** should not be empty. Because we should to know, who is moderator of this comment.

```ruby
@user.id == @comment.holder_id # => true
# => This user should be MODERATOR for this comment
```

## Denormalization

For building of Recent comments list (for polymorphic relationship) we need to have many additional requests to database. It's classic problem of polymorphic comments.

I use denormalization of commentable objects to solve this problem.

My practice shows - We need 3 denormalized fields into comment for (request-free) building of recent comments list:

<img src="https://raw.github.com/the-teacher/the_comments/master/docs/the_comments_view_5.gif" alt="the_comments">

* **Comment#commentable_title** - for example: "My first post about Ruby On Rails"
* **Comment#commentable_url** - for example: "/posts/1-my-first-post-about-ruby-on-rails"
* **Comment#commentable_state** - for example: "draft"

That is why any **Commentable Model should have few methods** to provide denormalization for Comments.

## Recent comments building

Denormalization makes building of Recent comments (for polymorphic relationship) very easy!

Controller:

```ruby
@comments = Comment.with_state(:published)
                   .where(commentable_state: [:published])
                   .order('created_at DESC')
                   .page(params[:page])
```

View:

```ruby
- @comments.each do |comment|
  %div
    %p= comment.commentable_title
    %p= link_to comment.commentable_title, comment.commentable_url
    %p= comment.content
```

### AntiSpam system

**1) Moderation**

**2) User agent must have:**

* Cookies support
* JavaScript and Ajax support

_Usually spambots not support Cookies and JavaScript_

**3) Comment form mast have:**

* fake (hidden via css) fields

_Usually spambots puts data in fake inputs_

**4) Trap via time:**

* User should be few seconds on page, before comment sending (by default 5 sec)

_Usually spambots works faster, than human. We can try to use this feature of behavior_

**5) IP and User Agent blacklists**


### Strong dependencies of gem

```ruby
gem 'the_sortable_tree'
gem 'state_machine'
```

* **the_sortable_tree** - render helper for nested set
* **state_machine** - states for moderation and callbacks for recalculating of counters when state of comment was changed

## Customization

You can use **generators** for copy files into your Application. After that you can customize almost everything

Generators list:

```ruby
bundle exec rails g the_comments --help
```

Copy View files for customization:

```ruby
bundle exec rails g the_comments:views assets
bundle exec rails g the_comments:views views
```

Copy Helper file for tree customization:

For more info read [TheSortableTree doc](https://github.com/the-teacher/the_sortable_tree)

```ruby
bundle exec rails g the_comments:views helper
```

## About author

Yes, It's true - I was a school teacher in the past.
That's why my login is the-teacher.
Now I'm ruby/frontend developer and [food-blogger](http://open-cook.ru).
I learn, I teach, I make a code. And sorry for my English.

## What about specs?

This gem - just first prototype of my ideas about comment system.
Unfortunatly, I have no time to write many tests for this gem.
Release 1.0.0 works for my pet projects - it's enough for me.
If you have a problem with gem and you can to create coverage tests for this problem - I will be happy to get your pull request.

### Where I can find example of application with the_comments?

This gem is part of new version of my food-blog about modern russian home cuisine. There is code of my tasty CMS [open-cook](https://github.com/open-cook/open-cook)
